# Plotly & Bellybutton BioDiversity 

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to create a dashboards so that each volunteer could access the study's information regarding the bacteria in their belly buttons.

This repository contains the following completed deliverables: 

1. A Horizontal Bar Chart showcasing the volunteer's top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) displayed based on the individual's ID.
